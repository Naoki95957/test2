Obviously by the title for the file this will be used to hold notes
or other information I find I may need to remeber or think is important.
I would like to have my little list grow and maybe to the point where 
this is impractical.

for starters, these are the terms I know:
git init	starts the git (master) thing
git status	shows what you have
git log		shows what you've done
git push	export
git pull	import
git clone	import, but sets user as master to repo. (followed by url of repo)
touch		makes blank a file, whatever is added after is the file name
ls		directories
cd		change directory
git add		add to your status
git remote	idk
git commit 	makes a "snapshot" of your added file

In terms of combinations:
git remote add origin (url)	well idk remote, but this sets the url to repo
git remote set-head		sets the branch name
git push -u origin master	sends the added commit to url
