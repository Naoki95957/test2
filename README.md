My second test, entirely on GitBash (NVM that xD...)
=====
So I made this file by typing "mkdir ~/(file name)".
Then I opened the file in vim and am editing it as of now.
I now learned that I NEED a repository to be made online with the URL 
added to the origin by typing "Git remote add origin (URL)".
:pizza:
